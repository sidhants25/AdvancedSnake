Take Note of the Following Instructions: 
1. Use WASD/Arrow Keys to Move. Press Space to Pause 
2. There are 3 types of food.             
   I. Pink-colored food increase score and length by one.         
   II. Red-colored apples increase score by two, reverse your direction and have a 5% chance to reset your score.
